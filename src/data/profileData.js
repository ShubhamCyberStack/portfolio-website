  // About / Summary
  about: `As a Cloud and DevOps enthusiast, I am building my expertise in cloud-native technologies, automation, and infrastructure engineering. I work with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, and Git — while exploring CI/CD practices and security best practices.

With a background in Computer Science and a strong passion for cloud computing and information security, I enjoy solving real-world problems through hands-on projects. My current focus is on automating deployments, containerizing applications, and implementing secure cloud architectures using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

I've gained practical experience through academic projects at Panipat Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I've worked on:
• Deploying scalable applications on AWS EC2 with Docker and Nginx
• Implementing Zero Trust security models in cloud environments
• Building CI/CD pipelines and automating infrastructure workflows
• Linux system administration and secure cloud deployments

Tech Stack I'm Working With:
Docker | AWS (EC2, S3, IAM) | Azure | Linux | Git | GitHub | Nginx | Security (Zero Trust) | Terraform (learning)

What drives me is the curiosity to learn, build, experiment, and improve. I'm constantly working on hands-on projects, contributing to open-source, and documenting my learning journey to deepen my understanding of the DevOps and Cloud ecosystem.

Open to connecting with professionals, mentors, and fellow learners in the DevOps and Cloud space. Let's build reliable, scalable, and secure systems together.`,
